## What is a blogging carnival

A _blogging carnival_ is an event to encourage folks to post about a particular
topic. Every month, there's a theme or discussion prompt for participants to
respond to, and at the end of the month there's a roundup post linking to
everyone's submissions. The idea is to encourage discussion and bring attention
to blogs that might otherwise go unnoticed. Blogging carnivals are an artifact
of a bygone era of the web, and I want to bring them back.

## A new start

For over ten years, Sciatrix and Siggy organized an asexual blogging carnival
called
[A Carnival of Aces](https://asexualagenda.wordpress.com/a-carnival-of-aces-masterpost/).
Later, Sennkestra organized an aromantic blogging carnival called
[A Carnival of Aros](https://carnivalofaros.wordpress.com/). Over time, the
communities around these carnivals shrank, and by 2023-2024 they had mostly
fizzled out. I participated in both regularly for several years under a
different name.

I'm primarily starting this carnival as a discussion group for some IRL friends,
but would love to open it up to new contributors if there's interest. With sites
like [Neocities](https://neocities.org/), there's been a renewed interest in
blogging and personal sites, and I'm hoping to help grow a new community of aro
and ace bloggers. If you're reading this, you're welcome to participate!

## How it works

Traditionally, every month, a different blog hosts the carnival. They come up
with that month's theme and post a call for submissions, folks send them links
to their submissions, and at the end of the month they post a roundup linking to
and summarizing everyone's posts. For now, I plan to just host the carnival
here, but if it attracts a lot of submissions, that may change!

Submissions can take any form! Some examples:

- A blog post on a personal site or platform like Tumblr
- A Twitter/Bluesky/Mastodon/Threads thread
- A video essay
- A piece of art or photo
- A musical composition

If you don't have anywhere to post it yourself, you may also request a guest
post on the host's blog.

Hosts pick a "theme" rather than a specific prompt to give contributors a lot of
freedom in choosing what to write about, but they may also give examples of
potential prompts as inspiration. You don't need to respond to more than one of
them, and you're more than free to choose your own or take the theme in a
different direction!

For ideas about what possible themes might look like, see the
[Carnival of Aces](https://asexualagenda.wordpress.com/a-carnival-of-aces-masterpost/)
and [Carnival of Aros](https://carnivalofaros.wordpress.com/) for many years of
examples.

theme.
