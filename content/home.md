## This Site

I'm tired of the big business corpo web. I'm tired of social media. I miss the
era of blogs and personal sites and silly little things people build on the
internet just for the fun of it.

I make websites professionally, but I've come to be disillusioned with the
modern web. I want to go back to when computing was fun and simple. I'm drawn to
the principles of the smallweb and the indieweb movements, so I'm building my
own little corner of the web where things are simpler.

This site is just some HTML and CSS that I wrote with my own two paws. I'm
always happy to have guests, so feel free to make yourself at home.
