My friends have pulled me onto a project of theirs: Building a smart DIY sex
toy. Between them, they have all the expertise they needâ€”except for someone to
write the firmware. I've been meaning to get into embedded development for a
while, and this project has been a great opportunity to do so. I'm building the
device on the ESP32 platform, and you can find the source repo
[here](https://github.com/justlark/squirtinator).

Lately I've been experimenting with immutable Linux distros; I'm currently test
driving [Fedora
Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/). I'm pretty
impressed so far; I think the immutable paradigm holds a lot of promise, and I
think some of these distros are starting to get to a level of polish and
usability where they're ready for mainstream use.

In January 2025 I'm going on a trip to Iceland with my polycule! We're all very
excited for it.
