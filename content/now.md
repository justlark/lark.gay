I'm [building this site](https://github.com/justlark/lark.gay)! I'm trying out a
static site generator called [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), because Hugo is
too complex for my needs, and I much prefer the Jinja/Tera templating syntax.
I'm tired of building big business corpo websites with complex frameworks and
lots of JS; I want to build something small and simple and bespoke.

I've been experimenting with immutable Linux distros. I'm currently test driving
[Fedora Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/sl/atomic-desktops/silverblue/). I
think the concept holds a lot of promise, and we're at a point where some of
these distros are really starting to mature.

I'm reading [Empire of Normality: Neurodiversity and
Capitalism](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123844668-empire-of-normality).
It's phenomenal; I might write a review once I'm done.

I have some trips with my polycule coming up on the calendar, and I'm really
excited for them.

My Year of Saying Yes to Things has been a huge success. I've had a lot of good
experiences this year and really expanded my comfort zone as a result. That's
come at the expense of personal time, however. Lately I've been trying to give
myself more Lark Time to relax and work on projects like this.
