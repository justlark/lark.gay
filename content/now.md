I'm going to be teaching a class on how to make websites at a local makerspace
on 6 May 2025! If that's where you're visiting from, welcome!

I've recently acquired new a special interest in public transit! I've never
thought of myself as much of a train autist, but I'm very down to live the
stereotype. I'm already planning to organize a polycule trip to DC once the new
[Avelia Liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avelia_Liberty) Acela transets
enter service, which will purportedly be in Spring 2025. I'll be happy if it
happens before 2026.

I'm starting work on a new project with a friend: building an app for con
organizers to create and publish con schedules. We have ambitious ideas for the
project, but the core of it will be a service that turns a spreadsheet into a
website that lets attendees view the con schedule. Attendees will be able to
search, sort, filter, and maybe even build themselves a personal itinerary. We
see a lot of cons try to homebrew a solution to this problem, and we want to
make it easier on organizers and a better experience for attendees. We have no
plans to monetize it; we just think it would be cool if people used it.

I'm going to be taking a trip to New York City for a couple days for work. My
job doesn't ordinarily have me traveling very much, but my manager offered to
send me to a conference. I don't particularly care about the con, but I decided
to jump on the opportunity to explore NYC on the company's dime.
