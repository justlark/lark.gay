I'm currently knee-deep in my next project, which is a tool for connecting
organizations with volunteers. It's called [Not Without
Help](https://notwithout.help/). I'm still trying to figure out exactly what the
ultimate scope of the project will be, but so far I have something that's
functional end-to-end and has all the core features I'm looking to add.

Some furries in my community are organizing to try and [create a furry-run co-op
art studio and makerspace](@/log/furry-art-space.md). I'm not closely involved
in the project, but I'm excited to see where it goes and contribute where I can.

My friends have pulled me onto a project of theirs: Building a smart DIY sex
toy. Between them, they have all the expertise they need--except for someone to
write the firmware. I've been meaning to get into embedded development for a
while, and this project has been a great opportunity to do so. I'm building the
device on the ESP32 platform, and you can find the source repo
[here](https://github.com/justlark/squirtinator).

In January 2025 I'm going on a trip to Iceland with my polycule! We're all very
excited for it.
