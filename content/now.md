After several months of work, I'm reaching the point where
[FanJam](https://fanjam.live/), a free event planning app I'm building for small
cons, is ready to start showing off to people. There's tons left to do, but I
have a viable MVP that I can start soliciting feedback on, and maybe even start
approaching cons with.

I've been back working on [Ace Archive](https://acearchive.lgbt) lately. I have
a long backlog of technical work I want done, but I'm also having
[grander thoughts](@/log/amateur-archives.md) about the future of the project
and what it might look like. I was recently asked to give a talk about the
project for a local artist collective, which is exciting.

I've spent the past few months working on a puzzle game I'm calling _Dirty Money
in Somerset Valley_, and I'm nearing the point of having something ready to show
off. Here's the blurb:

> _Dirty Money in Somerset Valley_ is a singleplayer pen-and-paper puzzle game
> where you pore over documents and collect evidence to uncover the truth about
> corporate corruption in a small town.
