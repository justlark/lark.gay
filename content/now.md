I just got back from a trip to Iceland with my polycule. It was a ton of fun,
and really helped me feel like part of the family.

I've been [learning a new card game called Cuttle](@/log/cuttle.md). I'm excited
to try it out with some friends.

I've had a concept bouncing around in my head for a while for a pen-and-paper
puzzle game. I'm finally starting to work on it, although I suspect it might
take some time--making puzzles takes a lot of brain juice.

I'm currently knee-deep in my next project, which is a tool for connecting
organizations with volunteers. It's called [Not Without
Help](https://notwithout.help/). I'm still trying to figure out exactly what the
ultimate scope of the project will be, but so far I have something that's
functional end-to-end and has all the core features I'm looking to add.

My friends have pulled me onto a project of theirs: Building a smart DIY sex
toy. Between them, they have all the expertise they need--except for someone to
write the firmware. I've been meaning to get into embedded development for a
while, and this project has been a great opportunity to do so. I'm building the
device on the ESP32 platform, and you can find the source repo
[here](https://github.com/justlark/squirtinator).

Some furries in my community are organizing to try and [create a furry-run co-op
art studio and makerspace](@/log/furry-art-space.md). I'm not closely involved
in the project, but I'm excited to see where it goes and contribute where I can.
