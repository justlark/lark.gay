I've been back working on [Ace Archive](https://acearchive.lgbt) lately. I have
a long backlog of technical work I want done, but I'm also having
[grander thoughts](@/log/amateur-archives.md) about the future of the project
and what it might look like.

I've spent the past few months working on a puzzle game I'm calling _Dirty Money
in Somerset Valley_, and I'm nearing the point of having something ready to show
off. Here's the blurb:

> _Dirty Money in Somerset Valley_ is a singleplayer pen-and-paper puzzle game
> where you pore over documents and collect evidence to uncover the truth about
> corporate corruption in a small town.

I've been fairly quiet the past few months because I've been busy working on a
new project: building an app for con organizers to create and publish con
schedules. I see a lot of cons try to homebrew a solution to this problem, and I
want to make it easier on organizers and a better experience for attendees. I
have no plans to monetize it; I just think it would be cool if people used it.
