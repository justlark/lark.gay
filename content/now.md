I've been back working on [Ace Archive](https://acearchive.lgbt) lately. I have
a long backlog of technical work I want done, but I'm also having grander
thoughts about the future of the project and what it might look like. Nothing
concrete yet--stay tuned.

I've spent the past few months working on a puzzle game I'm calling _Dirty Money
in Somerset Valley_, and I'm nearing the point of having something ready to show
off. Here's the blurb:

> _Dirty Money in Somerset Valley_ is a singleplayer pen-and-paper puzzle game
> where you pore over documents and collect evidence to uncover the truth about
> corporate corruption in a small town.

I'm starting work on a new project with a friend: building an app for con
organizers to create and publish con schedules. We have ambitious ideas for the
project, but the core of it will be a service that turns a spreadsheet into a
website that lets attendees view the con schedule. Attendees will be able to
search, sort, filter, and maybe even build themselves a personal itinerary. We
see a lot of cons try to homebrew a solution to this problem, and we want to
make it easier on organizers and a better experience for attendees. We have no
plans to monetize it; we just think it would be cool if people used it.
