If you want to reach out for any reason, feel free to shoot me an email. I love
hearing from folks!

‚úâÔ∏è [lark@lark.gay](mailto:lark@lark.gay)

You can also reach out over [Matrix](https://matrix.org), particularly if you
want to chat more securely.

If you want to drop me a message anonymously, I have an onion service set up to
receive anonymous messages. This is a special link that only works if you're
using [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/) as your web browser.

I also have a Bluesky! I don't really use it much right now; I've never been
very good at social media.
