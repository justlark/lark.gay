After some folks in my local furry community were struggling to find a venue to
organize a meetup, someone floated an idea: what if furries in my city had their
own venue? A space where they could host events, workshops, and classes,
socialize, and collaborate on projects? An art and maker space where folks would
have access to equipment and storage for their projects.

The crazy thing is that I think it might actually happen.

I'm excited by the idea of having a ["third
place"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place)â€”someplace I can escape to to
get out of the house, meet new people, work on projects, and feel a sense of
community. I think that's something I've been lacking: a broader sense of
community beyond just my extended friend network. I get some of that in kink,
but I'm not actually particularly active in the local scene these days. The kink
community is a context that frames most of my relationships and social
interactions, but it's not necessarily something I feel like I'm "part of"
beyond the people I am personally or transitively acquainted with.

I think having this third space will be particularly impactful for me because I
work from home, and so don't really have a "second place" either. I spend most
of my time either in my home or those of my friends; I don't spend much time out
in the world unless there's a specific activity attached, and there aren't
really any communal spaces I frequent.

The part of the process of planning and creating this space that has just
absolutely blown me away is how well-connected these folks are, along with the
range of impressive accomplishments they each personally bring to the table.

Within a few days they've assembled a team of local furries with experience in
leadership positions, community organizing, running art studios and maker
spaces, fundraising and applying for grants, and even an CPA accountant. They've
self-organized into working groups, established a membership model, and
collected pledges for membership fees totaling a few thousands dollars a month.

And this is all just from *word of mouth* over the span of about a week. I am
amazed by how much talent is concentrated in this community and how quickly
they've been able to mobilize to make this dream a reality.

The timeline is long; they're not expecting to be ready to move in until Spring
2026 at the earliest.

Still, I'm excited to see what happens.
