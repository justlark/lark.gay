So in my phone's contacts app, you can "star" some contacts. As far as I can
tell, this has two implications:

- Starred contacts float to the top of the list.
- You can configure starred contacts to bypass Do Not Disturb mode.

This is a fairly simple feature, but choosing which contacts to bless with a
star has proven difficult for reasons that are wrapped up in a lot of my
feelings about relationships.

For context, I'm aromatic and polyamorous, and I like to use the framework of
relationship anarchy[^1] to navigate the relationships in my life. In short,
that means I don't like to prioritize some kinds of relationships over others or
categorize them into to buckets, like "partner" as something distinct from (and
more important than) "friend". Every relationship in my life is special and
unique in its own way, and I could never compare or rank them. It's a rejection
of relationship hierarchies, much like social anarchism is a rejection of power
hierarchies.

Obviously starring contacts in my phone does not impose a hierarchy on my
friends. But it kinda *feels* that way. There's this unspoken implication that
features like this are intended to be used for your family and partners. Even
though it's a purely logistical decision, choosing which friends I want to star
feels like picking favorites.

I often complain about the ways in which our amatonormative society devalues
nonstandard relationship styles though institutions and systems that make
assumptions about how you structure your life. But this really isn't one of
those cases; my phone is just asking me who I want to be able to reach me when
it's on Do Not Disturb, which is a very fair question that shouldn't be causing
me so much angst.
