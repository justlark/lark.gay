I love experimenting with pronouns and the ways in which we refer to one
another.

I use they/it pronouns. I often have a difficult time articulating what exactly
it is about it/it that I enjoy; I guess I like the idea that my gender isn't
just nonbinary, but *other*.

In the same vein, there are other ways I like to play with pronouns. I also
enjoy:

1. Referring to myself in the third person.
2. When folks use my name as a common noun.
3. When folks use third-person pronouns in second-person contexts.

Using my name as a common noun could mean saying things like:

> "What's new with the lark?"

> "I found a lark!"

Using third-person pronouns in second-person contexts means that, when
addressing me directly, people use the third person, like this:

> "Would Lark like to go out to eat?"

> "I need to talk to Lark about something."

I've come to quite enjoy being referred to this way. A surprising number of my
friends have picked it up; once a few started doing it consistently, others
followed suit, without me ever talking to them about it.

I'm quite lucky to have friends who are willing to indulge me in these
experiments ðŸ’š
