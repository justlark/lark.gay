I love experimenting with pronouns and the ways in which we refer to one
another.

I use they/it pronouns; typically I prefer they/them with folks I don't know as
well, and it/it with my friends.

I often have a difficult time articulating what exactly it is about it/it that I
enjoy. It's definitely a gender thing; I like the idea that my gender isn't just
nonbinary, but *other*. It's not necessarily an objectification thing, but with
close friends it's also not *not* an objectification thing haha.

The ways I like to experiment with pronouns goes beyond that, though. I enjoy:

1. When folks use my name as a common noun.
2. When folks use this-person pronouns in second-person contexts.
3. Referring to myself in the third person.

Using my name as a common noun could mean saying things like:

> "What's the lark's favorite holiday?"

> "What's new with the lark?"

> "I found a lark!"

Using third-person pronouns in second-person contexts means that, when
addressing me directly, people use the third person, like this:

> Would Lark like to go out to eat?

> I need to talk to Lark about something.

I'll often find myself using big-L lark when using my name as a proper noun and
small-L lark when using it as a common noun.

I've come to quite enjoy being referred to this way. A surprising number of my
friends have picked it up; once a few started doing it consistently, others
followed suit, without me even talking to them about it.

I'm lucky to have friends who are willing to indulge me in these experiments ðŸ’š
