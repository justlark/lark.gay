I love experimenting with pronouns and the ways in which we refer to one
another.

I use they/it pronouns, but I often have a difficult time articulating what
exactly it is about it/it that I enjoy. It's definitely a gender thing; I like
the idea that my gender isn't just nonbinary, but *other*. It's not necessarily
an objectification thing, although with some friends it's not *not* an
objectification thing hehe.

The ways I like to experiment with pronouns goes beyond that, though. I enjoy:

1. Referring to myself in the third person.
2. When folks use my name as a common noun.
3. When folks use third-person pronouns in second-person contexts.

Using my name as a common noun could mean saying things like:

> "What's the lark's favorite holiday?"

> "What's new with the lark?"

> "I found a lark!"

Using third-person pronouns in second-person contexts means that, when
addressing me directly, people use the third person, like this:

> Would Lark like to go out to eat?

> I need to talk to Lark about something.

I'll often find myself using big-L lark when using my name as a proper noun and
small-L lark when using it as a common noun.

I've come to quite enjoy being referred to this way. A surprising number of my
friends have picked it up; once a few started doing it consistently, others
followed suit, without me ever talking to them about it.

I'm lucky to have friends who are willing to indulge me in these experiments ðŸ’š
