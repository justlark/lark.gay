*This has no relation to Google's Gemini large language model.*

[The Gemini protocol](https://geminiprotocol.net/) is a lightweight alternative
to the web. I'll often jokingly refer to it as "Web 0.5", playing on terms like
"Web 2.0" and "Web 3.0".

Over the past few decades, the web has grown into a behemoth—a massive, global
platform for building rich applications and networks that serve billions of
users. The smallweb movement presents an alternative: small websites and small
networks. Tight-knit communities of peers. A focus on content over presentation.

In its earliest iterations, the web was nothing more than a network of documents
that link to one another. Check out [the first ever
website](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) as an example. Over
time, the web has accumulated layers of complexity to enable the applications
it's used for today. That complexity comes at a cost, however: ballooning
resource usage requiring ever-more powerful computers, threats to our privacy,
and the commodification of our attention.

Gemini is a return to the principles of the early web: a network of documents
that link to one another. It's private, secure, and lightweight by
default—deliberately designed to head off any attempts to expand its scope or
complexity.

Instead of massive social media networks controlled by big tech monopolies,
Gemini is full of small blogs and personal sites hosted by individuals just for
the fun of it. If this appeals to you, I encourage you to give it a try. I
recommend downloading [Lagrange](https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/), a browser
like Chrome or Firefox, but for Gemini.

If you're interested in hosting your own Gemini site, I built [a simple static
site generator](https://github.com/justlark/gempost) that you might find useful.

I used to host a Gemini site under this domain. I've taken a break from it, but
might return someday. Amid the growing enshittification of the web, alternatives
like Gemini are starting to look more and more appealing. They won't replace the
web, but they don't need to. Gemini is a small, quiet corner I can retreat to
when I need a break, and I'm grateful for it.
