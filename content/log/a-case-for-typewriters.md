A few months ago I bought myself an electric typewriter. Friends were somewhat
baffled, given that I work in tech, but I've found that I actually really enjoy
using it.

For some background on what "electric typewriter" means, there are three main
categories of typewriters:

1. Manual typewriters
2. Electric typewriters
3. Electronic typewriters

Manual typewriters are the ones I think most folks are familiar with; each
keystroke moves a lever that causes the type element to strike the page, and
then the carriage moves the page one space to the left.

Electric typewriters are different in that pressing a key trips a sensor that
triggers a motor to move the type element.

With electronic typewriters, pressing a key adds the letter to an internal
memory buffer and displays it on a screen. Once you've buffered enough letters
(usually a single word), the typewriter types them all at once. This lets you
correct typos by seeing what you're about to type before it's committed to
paper.

Electric and electronic typewriters often come with some additional features
that aren't possible on a manual typewriter. Here are some of the notable
features of mine:

- **Correctable text**: There's a key to "erase" the previous character. Rather
  than strike an ink ribbon to put ink on the page, the type element strikes a
  piece of tape that lifts the ink back off the page.
- **Auto-centering text**: You can automatically center text by typing a full
  line into the memory buffer, after which it calculates what the offset should
  be to center the text and types it all at once.
- **Auto-return**: The typewriter automatically moves the carriage back to the
  left margin when you reach the right margin.
- **Bold and underline**: The typewriter can strike the page multiple times to
  make text bold, or with a separate underline character to underline it.
- **Superscript and subscript**: The typewriter feeds the page a half line up or
  down.

I like the my electronic typewriter because it's a good compromise between the
manual and electronic ones; I get the stimmy tactile feedback as the type
element strikes the page—which is a big part of the appeal for me—but I also
don't have to be stressed about typos or wasting paper.

But I still haven't answered the question of why own a typewriter in the first
place.

Between my job and hobbies, I spend a *lot* of time in front of a screen.
Computers are attention-grabbing and pull me away from my physical environment;
I can spend hours working on a personal project and fully disconnect from the
world around me, distorting the passage of time.

I don't like this sensation of realizing I've been absorbed for hours, and
typewriters solve that for me. Using a typewriter is a very manual and
intentional process that I find grounding and meditative. I'm sitting down to
use it for a specific purpose, without any distractions to divert my attention.
The process of it—lifting the bail, inserting the paper, turning the platen,
setting margins—is a ritual I really enjoy.

I mostly use it to write letters; I enjoy exchanging letters with my friends. I
find them to be a more personal and thoughtful way to express my appreciation
for someone—it's easier to be vulnerable the more asynchronous the communication
method is.

I also use it for taking notes occasionally. This one is situational, because I
need most of my notes in my notes app so I always have them available and can
search them, but some things I actually prefer to have on paper, like if I want
to pin them to the fridge to reference at home.

Often when writing notes or letters or stories, I get caught up fussing with
wording and structure, and that gets in the way of me actually getting my
thoughts out of my head. Because my typewriter makes editing more difficult, I'm
forced to just write, without being perfectly happy with what I've written. I
may go through multiple drafts, but there's a practical limit to how much I can
revise.

For me, one of the major hurdles to doing creative work is accepting that "good
enough" is good enough. To that end, my typewriter has been quite helpful.
