Last weekend I visited a [queer archive library](https://queer.archive.work/) in
Providence, RI, and it gave me a lot to think about. I read a zine by Paul
Soulellis called
[Survival by Sharing](https://soulellis.com/entries/survival.html), which is
about archival work and makes a case for archives that are small, disorganized,
private, and personal.

When I started Ace Archive, I felt a need to frame it as a big professional
project and pretend it wasn't just one queer with no training working out of its
bedroom. Maybe I thought I needed to justify its existence. As folks have
started to discover the project (through no help of my own; I'm terrible at
self-promoting), I think the justification has started to become evident. People
are contributing with research and advice. The site gets a good amount of
traffic. One person even
[curated an in-person ace history and art exhibit](https://luciellaes.itch.io/nonlimerent-monosexual-digital-edition)
using Ace Archive as a resource. And most importantly, I'm starting to gain the
confidence that maybe all the work I've put in actually means something.

That queer library we visited could hardly be called a library; it was a few
unorganized bookshelves and a few bins full of zines sharing space with a print
studio. It was beautiful. Putting queer history in queer hands and sharing it
around feels so much more profound than locking it away in a neoclassical marble
vault.

Maybe Ace Archive is allowed to be amateur. Maybe that's even the point.

I've also been thinking about
[this article](https://longform.asmartbear.com/little-company/) on how to
position yourself to customers as a startup. It advises founders to lean into
the benefits of being a small company with small customers, rather than trying
to pretend to be something they're not. I hesitate to equate this to Ace
Archive--this is not a business and my values and goals do not align with
startup culture or capitalist motives--but I think some of the advice is
applicable. As I start to look for collaborators, I want to find people who
value Ace Archive for what it is.

An idea I've had for the project for a long time is to curate content in the
archive into "collections", so that people can browse and discover ace history
more easily--make Ace Archive an educational resource rather than just a
repository. I've dismissed the idea in the past because I was afraid it wouldn't
"scale". But maybe it doesn't need to. Maybe I should be more realistic about
how large this archive is _actually_ likely to get and take advantage of the
fact that I can personally browse and curate everything in it.

So I've done [exactly that](https://acearchive.lgbt/artifacts/)! I've already
curated a handful of collections, and I'll likely do more as I have time and as
new material comes in.

As always, if this project interests you, [get in touch](@/contact.md). Every
person who contributes with research, advice, or even just a friendly hello
warms my gay little heart.
