Every new year, I designate a theme for the coming calendar year. Different from
a resolution--rather than prescribe specific goals--it provides a framework to
influence the decisions I make over the course of the coming year.

My theme for 2025 was "Get involved". The goals was to connect more with my
communities, attend more events, and do more community-building and activist
work. It took until the tail end of the year for me to really start delivering
on this goal, but I'd say it was a success!

Here are some of the accomplishments I made this year:

- I started attending more local meetups.
- I started attending more protests and political actions.
- I did a lot of networking around Ace Archive. I feel like "networking" as a
  concept is poisoned by the corporate world; what I really mean is I went out
  of my way to meet folks, build connections, and tell them about my work. And
  good things came of it! I've given interviews, given talks, recruited
  volunteers, and started to build a community around the project.
- I got involved with my local makerspace, connecting with folks there are
  hosting events.
- I went to my first LARP, which was a ton of fun.
- I started attending a monthly furry meetup in my city and building connections
  with the folks there. I really pushed through the anxiety to make sure I
  attended very month and went out of my way to talk to new people. The first
  few months were rough at times; I felt like an outsider in a space where it
  felt like everyone had known each other for years. But now I feel like a part
  of that community, and I've started to build some real friendships.

My theme for 2026 is my "year of collaboration". I've got a lot of projects I'm
working on, but for the most part they've been solo endeavors. I want to start
collaborating with folks on some of the work I do--not just for the benefit of
the projects, but also to build community, because building community is the
antidote to despair I need right now. I've already been doing a lot of that with
Ace Archive, and I'm going to need to start doing that with FanJam if I want to
reach people who would benefit from it.

If you're reading this, leave a comment letting me know what your theme for 2026
is! I love this tradition and I've managed to get several of my friends on board
with it.
