I recently gave a talk about [Ace Archive](https://acearchive.lgbt) for a local
artist collective. I got some good advice about community organizing, and a few
folks expressed interest in contributing to the project. I realized that if I
want to build a community around Ace Archive, I need a community space. So I
decided to set up a Discord server for folks interested in the project. You can
join [here](https://discord.gg/Pk54SzxA8m/).

As part of that Discord server, I put together a list of ways people can
contribute to the project besides contributing code. I want to lower the barrier
to contributing as much as possible, because giving people an accessible way to
get involved is how you build community.

After several months of work, I'm reaching the point where
[FanJam](https://fanjam.live/), a free event planning app I'm building for small
cons, is ready to start showing off to people. There's tons left to do, but I
have a viable MVP that I can start soliciting feedback on, and maybe even start
approaching cons with.

I've spent the past few months working on a puzzle game I'm calling _Dirty Money
in Somerset Valley_, and I'm nearing the point of having something ready to show
off. Here's the blurb:

> _Dirty Money in Somerset Valley_ is a singleplayer pen-and-paper puzzle game
> where you pore over documents and collect evidence to uncover the truth about
> corporate corruption in a small town.

Right now _Dirty Money_ is on hiatus as I shift focus to Ace Archive and FanJam,
but I'm hoping to pick it back up when those projects settle down.

I recently got into [GregTech: New Horizons](https://www.gtnewhorizons.com/), a
hardcore technical modpack for Minecraft. It's pretty punishing, but I'm having
a ton of fun. It's been years since I've been able to get sucked into a
singleplayer game; I typically struggle to make time for leisure activities, and
so I think having this has been good for me.
