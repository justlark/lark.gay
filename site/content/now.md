## Ace Archive

I recently gave a talk about [Ace Archive](https://acearchive.lgbt) for a local
artist collective. I got some good advice about community organizing, and a few
folks expressed interest in contributing to the project. I realized that if I
want to build a community around Ace Archive, I need a community space. So I
decided to set up a Discord server for folks interested in the project. You can
join [here](https://discord.gg/Pk54SzxA8m).

As part of that Discord server, I put together a list of ways people can
contribute to the project besides contributing code. I want to lower the barrier
to contributing as much as possible, because giving people an accessible way to
get involved is how you build community.

## Anthro New England

I'm going to Anthro New England in January! I'll be hosting a panel about Ace
Archive and co-hosting a panel about my local makerspace. I want 2026 to be the
year I really start going to more furry events, so in the coming months I'm also
planning on going to Furcationland in Portland, Maine and Eufuria in Albany, New
York.

## FanJam

After several months of work, I'm reaching the point where
[FanJam](https://fanjam.live/), a free event planning app I'm building for small
cons, is ready to start showing off to people. There's tons left to do, but I
have a viable MVP that I can start soliciting feedback on, and maybe even start
approaching cons with.

## _Dirty Money in Somerset Valley_

I've spent the past few months working on a puzzle game I'm calling _Dirty Money
in Somerset Valley_, and I'm nearing the point of having something ready to show
off. Here's the blurb:

> _Dirty Money in Somerset Valley_ is a singleplayer pen-and-paper puzzle game
> where you pore over documents and collect evidence to uncover the truth about
> corporate corruption in a small town.

Right now _Dirty Money_ is on hiatus as I shift focus to Ace Archive and FanJam,
but I'm hoping to pick it back up when those projects settle down.
